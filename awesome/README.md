# Configuration and themes for Awesome Window Manager

This is my configuration and themes for [awesome window manager](https://awesomewm.org/) 4.x.
It is heavily based on ideas from [Awesome WM Copycats](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats).

## Install

The configuration and all the themes use widgets and utilities from [Lain](https://github.com/lcpz/lain) 
and [Awesome Freedesktop](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-freedesktop).

### Install dependencies

```shell
git clone https://github.com/lcpz/lain.git ~/.config/awesome/lain
git clone https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-freedesktop.git ~/.config/awesome/freedesktop
```

### Install configuration and themes

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Kajtek/config.git
cp -r config/awesome/* ~/.config/awesome/
```
